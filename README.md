# 🧪 Laboratório de Nanomateriais (LabNano)

Welcome to the GitHub repository of **Laboratório de Nanomateriais**, a research group at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Our lab focuses on growth, caracterization and application of materials in nanometric scale, as well as eletronic transport measurements.

## 📁 Our Projects

* **[special-measure](https://github.com/labnano/special-measure)**: Fork of a MATLAB-based tool for instrument control and transport measurements.
* **[nanomeasure](https://github.com/labnano/nanomeasure)**: A Python library and GUI application to bring a modern alternative to special-measure.
* **[transferencia](https://github.com/labnano/transferencia)**: A Arduino based PID controller for temperature in our transfer system.
* **[BookStack](https://github.com/labnano/BookStack)**: A small fork of the BookStack wiki creation tool tailored for our lab's documentation needs.
